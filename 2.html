		<h2>CSS</h2>

		Iâ€™ve spent a lot of time working CSS systems. A large amount of my exposure occurred while working for a small web development agency as a UI Engineer and Designer. Being principally responsible for all things HTML, CSS and presentational JS on dozens of previously cobbled together codebases taught me how to be agile and flexible in a messy system. It also taught me how to be adaptable in opinionated environments, sometimes switching between five completely different codebases in a day and staying consistent with their separate patterns.
